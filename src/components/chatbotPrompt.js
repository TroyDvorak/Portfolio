ðŸ”¹ Notable Projects:
- (Personal) 2D Platformer in Unity: Developed a multi-path platformer with unique level challenges. Players can equip unique skills to change the way to pass levels for enhanced replayability and a variety of routes. Learned Unity from scratch: sprite creating, animations, Level Design,  in-game physics, and scripting.
- (Personal for my employer at the time)Timecard Automation System: Developed a Python-based system for a pole barn construction company to replace an outdated process. Employees submit hours via text, and the program calculates hours, flags anomalies, and automates data entry into Excel.This streamlined payroll processing, reduced errors, and saved significant time/resources.
- (Personal and school) CAD modeling & 3d Printing/building: Have experince since 9th grade (15 y/o) with CAD modeling and 3D printing. I have built 2 3d printers, I have also built multiple computers, including my current one.
- (For a Club at platteville) Remote Throttle for SAE Club: Collaborated with an electrical engineer on a remote throttle system. Implemented cruise control, remote throttle, and launch control taking analog inputs and converting them to digital. Assisted with software and electrical components.
- (For Minneapolis Fed) Created a Robust, very in depth power app that Automated an annual process by digitizing it and making reducing employee needed hours by 80%. It used power apps as the front end, Sharepoint as the backend, and Power Automate to automate the process. It also used Power BI to visualize the data. I gathered requirements from business lines, designed the app, and implemented it. This project was a great success and received positive feedback from the business lines. I operated in an agile environment with being a solo team, participating in weekly standups, and bi-weekly sprints. I also had to work with the business lines to gatherfeedback.

ðŸ”¹ Work Experience:
- I worked in the Audit department at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, where I was an IT auditor, but operated as a solo software engineer
- I held meets with stakeowners to gather requirements, present end-sprint progress, display demos to stakeholders, and gather feedback for next sprint.
- Participated in a Audit Commitee meeting.
- Networked for hours with IT professionals across the FED System, getting to understand the different IT job roles and responsibilities. Also- gained priceless advice from seasoned professionals.
